Step 1: Creating VPC
1. Open the VPC dashboard and click on "Create VPC"
2. Select "VPC and more".
3. Give a name to the VPC e.g. Hello-World-vpc.
4. In Availability Zones, choose 2.
5. In Public as well as private subnets, choose 2.(One per AZ)
6. For NAT Gateway, Zonal > choose in 1 AZ (for cost saving).
7. For VPC endpoint, keep "S3 Gateway" enabled.
8. Create VPC.



Step 2: Security Groups ("Firewalls")
1. Go to EC2 Console and click on security group.
2. We need to create 3 security groups.
  2.1 For the ALB: Configure inbound traffic from HTTP(80) and HTTPS(443) ports , source being 0.0.0.0/0, outbound traffic to all traffic.(ALB-SG)
  2.2 For EC2 instance: Configure inbound traffic from HTTP(80), source being the security group created for ALB, outbound traffic to all traffic.(App-SG)
  2.3 For RDS: Configure inbound traffic from MySQL/Aurora(3306), source being the security group created for EC2 instance and outbound traffic to all 			traffic.(DB-SG)



Step 3: RDS Database ("Vault")
1. Go to RDS Console and click on Subnet Groups.
2. Click Create DB Subnet Group.
3. Name: rds-private-subnet-group; Description: Subnets for private RDS access only.; VPC: Hello-World VPC
4. Add subnets: AZ: Select two AZs used for EC2 instances. Subnets: Select the Private Subnets associated with AZs.
5. Launch the RDS DB: In RDS Console, Database > Create database. 
  3.1 Choose creation method: Full configuration; Engine type: MySQL; Templates: Free Tier / Sandbox (1 instance) 
  3.2 Settings: DB instance identifier: hello-world-db; Master username: admin; Password: Create a strong one and save it securely.
  3.3 Instance configuration: db.t4g.micro (Use Graviton2 chips- cheaper and faster)
  3.4 Connectivity: Compute resource: Don't connect to an EC2 compute resource; VPC: Hello-World-VPC; DB Subnet Group: rds-private-subnet-group; Public access: No; VPC security group: Choose existing; Existing VPC security groups: DB-SG


Step 4: IAM Role ("ID Badge")
1. Go to IAM Dashboard > Roles > Create Role.
2. Trusted entity type: AWS service, Use case: EC2
3. Permission Policies: AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore (Allows login via browser without SSH keys)
4. Role name: Rach-Hello-World-EC2-Role
5. Click Create Role
